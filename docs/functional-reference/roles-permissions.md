# Roles & Permissions Reference

Comprehensive reference for all roles, permissions, and access control in QB Engineer. Derived from actual source code (`[Authorize]` attributes on controllers, Angular `roleGuard()` on routes, and sidebar `allowedRoles` filtering).

---

## 1. Role Definitions

QB Engineer defines six roles. Roles are **additive** -- a user can hold multiple roles simultaneously, and their effective permissions are the **union** of all assigned roles.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full system access. User management, role assignment, system settings, track type configuration, integrations, compliance forms, MFA policy, scheduled tasks, terminology, audit log, EDI. The only role that can create/modify users, configure the system, or manage compliance form templates. |
| **Manager** | Operational leadership. Everything PM can do plus: assign work to others, approve expenses, correct time entries, manage events, training administration, employee management, shop floor terminal setup, scheduling, MRP, OEE, asset management. |
| **PM** (Project Manager) | Planning and sales focus. Backlog curation, planning cycles, lead management, reporting, customer management, quotes, sales orders, estimates, customer returns. Read-only board access (no card management operations). |
| **Engineer** | Technical execution. Kanban board access, assigned work, file attachments, expense logging, time tracking, parts catalog, inventory, quality inspections, lot tracking, FMEA, PPAP. |
| **OfficeManager** | Administrative and financial operations. Customer/vendor management, purchase orders, invoices, payments, shipments, inventory, compliance form review, payroll administration, expense settings view. |
| **ProductionWorker** | Shop floor execution. Simplified task list, start/stop timer, move cards within production stages, add notes/photos, inventory viewing, lot tracking, planning cycle participation. No nav menu, dashboards, settings, or admin features in the worker view. |

---

## 2. Role Hierarchy

Roles are **not hierarchical** in a strict inheritance sense -- they are independent, additive sets of permissions. However, in practice the roles form a rough capability ladder:

```
Admin (everything)
  |
Manager (operations + PM capabilities + approvals)
  |
PM (planning + sales + reporting)          OfficeManager (finance + admin ops)
  |                                              |
Engineer (technical execution)             ProductionWorker (shop floor)
```

**Key relationships:**
- **Admin** has access to every feature and every API endpoint
- **Manager** has access to nearly everything except system configuration (users, settings, integrations, track types, reference data, terminology, audit log, EDI, MFA policy, scheduled tasks)
- **PM** and **OfficeManager** are peer roles with different domain focus (PM = sales/planning, OfficeManager = finance/procurement)
- **Engineer** has broad technical access but no financial, HR, or administrative capabilities
- **ProductionWorker** has the most restricted access, limited to direct production tasks

## 7. Kiosk / Shop Floor Authentication

The shop floor display (`/display/shop-floor`) uses a tiered authentication system optimized for speed in a manufacturing environment.

### 7.1 Authentication Tiers

| Tier | Method | Speed | Use Case |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | RFID / NFC badge tap + PIN | Fastest | Primary kiosk auth. Employee taps badge, enters 4-6 digit PIN. |
| **Tier 2** | Barcode scan + PIN | Fast | Fallback for workers without NFC. USB barcode scanner reads badge. |
| **Tier 3** | Username + Password | Standard | Desktop/mobile login. Also available as "Manual Login" on kiosk. |
| **Tier 4** | Enterprise SSO (Google/Microsoft/OIDC) | Standard | Cloud deployments only. Not applicable to kiosk (no browser redirect). |

### 7.2 Kiosk Endpoints (Anonymous)

The shop floor display operates on a trusted LAN without requiring authentication for read operations:

- `GET /api/v1/display/shop-floor` -- Overview (jobs, workers, status)
- `GET /api/v1/display/shop-floor/clock-status` -- Worker clock status
- `GET /api/v1/display/shop-floor/search` -- Kiosk search (jobs + parts only)
- `POST /api/v1/display/shop-floor/identify-scan` -- Identify scanned badge/barcode
- `POST /api/v1/display/shop-floor/clock` -- Clock in/out
- `GET /api/v1/display/shop-floor/teams` -- Team listing
- `GET /api/v1/display/shop-floor/terminal` -- Terminal config lookup

### 7.3 Kiosk Management (Admin + Manager)

Terminal and team configuration requires authentication:

- `POST /api/v1/display/shop-floor/teams` -- Create team
- `PUT/DELETE /api/v1/display/shop-floor/teams/{id}` -- Update/delete team
- `GET/PUT /api/v1/display/shop-floor/teams/{id}/members` -- Team membership
- `GET /api/v1/display/shop-floor/terminals` -- List terminals
- `POST /api/v1/display/shop-floor/terminal` -- Setup terminal

### 7.4 PIN Management

- PINs are separate from passwords -- short numeric codes (4-6 digits) for quick kiosk auth only
- PINs are hashed at rest (PBKDF2), never stored in plaintext
- Users set their own PIN during account setup (required only if scan hardware is configured)
- Admin can reset a user's PIN (generates temporary PIN, user must change on next scan)
- Lockout after 5 consecutive failed PIN attempts (configurable), admin reset required

### 7.5 Role-to-Tier Mapping

All roles can use all authentication tiers. The tier selection is based on the **environment**, not the role:

| Environment | Primary Tier | Fallback |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Shop floor kiosk | Tier 1 (NFC) or Tier 2 (barcode) | Tier 3 (manual login link) |
| Desktop browser | Tier 3 (credentials) | Tier 4 (SSO, if configured) |
| Mobile app | Tier 3 (credentials) | Tier 4 (SSO, if configured) |

---

## 8. MFA Policy

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) uses TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) and is managed via the Admin panel.

### 8.1 MFA Endpoints

| Endpoint | Auth Required | Notes |
|----------|:------------:|-------|
| `POST /auth/mfa/setup` | Yes | Begin MFA setup (any authenticated user) |
| `POST /auth/mfa/verify-setup` | Yes | Verify TOTP setup |
| `DELETE /auth/mfa/disable` | Yes | Disable own MFA |
| `DELETE /auth/mfa/devices/{id}` | Yes | Remove a device |
| `GET /auth/mfa/status` | Yes | Check own MFA status |
| `POST /auth/mfa/challenge` | No | Create challenge during login |
| `POST /auth/mfa/validate` | No | Validate TOTP code during login |
| `POST /auth/mfa/recovery` | No | Use recovery code |
| `POST /auth/mfa/recovery-codes` | Yes | Generate new recovery codes |

### 8.2 Admin MFA Policy

| Endpoint | Required Role | Notes |
|----------|:------------:|-------|
| `GET /admin/mfa/compliance` | Admin | View MFA compliance status across all users |
| `PUT /admin/mfa/policy` | Admin | Set which roles are required to have MFA enabled |

The MFA policy is role-based:
- Admin configures which roles **must** have MFA enabled (e.g., require MFA for Admin and Manager roles)
- The `SetMfaPolicy` command accepts a list of `RequiredRoles`
- Users in required roles who haven't set up MFA will be prompted/enforced
- Non-required roles can still opt in to MFA voluntarily

### 8.3 MFA Flow

1. **Login** -- User submits credentials (Tier 3) or scan+PIN (Tier 1/2)
2. **MFA check** -- If user has MFA enabled, server returns a `challengeToken` instead of a JWT
3. **Challenge** -- Client prompts for TOTP code or recovery code
4. **Validation** -- Client submits code; on success, server returns the full JWT
5. **Remember device** -- Optional; skips MFA for trusted devices (time-limited)

---

## 9. Angular Guards

The Angular frontend enforces route-level access via guards defined in `shared/guards/`:

| Guard | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `authGuard` | `auth.guard.ts` | Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` |
| `roleGuard(...roles)` | `role.guard.ts` | Checks `AuthService.hasAnyRole(allowedRoles)`. Redirects unauthorized users to `/dashboard`. |
| `setupRequiredGuard` | `setup.guard.ts` | Only allows access to `/setup` when initial setup is needed |
| `setupCompleteGuard` | `setup.guard.ts` | Only allows access to `/login` when setup is complete |
| `mobileRedirectGuard` | `mobile-redirect.guard.ts` | Redirects mobile devices to `/m` routes |
| `unsavedChangesGuard` | `unsaved-changes.guard.ts` | Warns before navigating away from dirty forms |

The `roleGuard` is a factory function that returns a `CanActivateFn`. Usage:

```typescript
canActivate: [roleGuard('Admin', 'Manager', 'PM')]
```

**Important:** The route guard only controls navigation. API endpoints independently enforce authorization via `[Authorize(Roles)]` attributes. A user who somehow reaches a restricted page will still be blocked by the API.

---

## 10. Role Assignment Rules

- Roles are stored in `AspNetUserRoles` (ASP.NET Identity)
- Only **Admin** can assign or modify roles
- Roles are not mutually exclusive -- a user can hold any combination
- Common combinations:
  - Solo operator: Admin (single user has all access)
  - Shop supervisor: Manager + Engineer
