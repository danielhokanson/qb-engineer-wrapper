# Employees

## Overview

The Employees feature provides a dedicated management interface for viewing and managing employee records, distinct from the Admin user management panel. While the Admin panel (`/admin/users`) focuses on user account administration (creating accounts, assigning roles, managing setup tokens, scan identifiers), the Employees feature (`/employees`) provides a comprehensive employee profile view with ten detail tabs spanning time tracking, pay, training, compliance, jobs, events, expenses, documents, and activity.

The feature serves Admin and Manager roles as a read-only dashboard into each employee's operational footprint across the entire system. Employee creation and account management remain in the Admin panel -- the Employees feature surfaces employee data from across all other features in a unified view.

---

## Routes & Navigation

| Route | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `/employees` | `EmployeeListComponent` | Employee list page with filters and DataTable |
| `/employees/:id` | Redirects to `/employees/:id/overview` | Default redirect to overview tab |
| `/employees/:id/:tab` | `EmployeeDetailComponent` | Employee detail page with tab navigation |

The feature is lazy-loaded via `EMPLOYEES_ROUTES` in `employees.routes.ts`. The detail page uses `:tab` route parameters with a redirect from the bare `:id` path to `:id/overview`.

Available tabs: `overview`, `time`, `pay`, `training`, `compliance`, `jobs`, `events`, `expenses`, `documents`, `activity`.

---

## Access & Permissions

The `EmployeesController` requires Admin or Manager role for all endpoints:

```
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]
```

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| Admin | Full read access to all employees and all tabs |
| Manager | Full read access to all employees and all tabs |
| Engineer | No access |
| Production Worker | No access |
| PM | No access |
| Office Manager | No access |

Managers see employees scoped by the backend -- `GetEmployeeListQuery` receives the caller's user ID and admin status, allowing the backend to apply visibility rules (e.g., managers may only see their team members, though current implementation shows all).

---

## Employee List

The `EmployeeListComponent` renders a `PageHeaderComponent` with inline filters and a DataTable.

### Page Header & Filters

| Control | Type | Behavior |
|---------|------|----------|
| Search | `<app-input>` with `FormControl` | Free-text search (sent as `?search=` to API) |
| Role | `<app-select>` with null option | Filters by role. Options loaded from `ReferenceDataService.getRolesAsOptions()` with "-- All Roles --" null option. |
| Status | `<app-select>` with null option | Filters by active status. Options: All, Active, Inactive. |

Filters are applied via `loadEmployees()`, which sends all filter values as query parameters to `GET /api/v1/employees`.

### DataTable Columns

| Column | Field | Type | Width | Sortable | Filterable |
|--------|-------|------|-------|----------|------------|
| Name | `name` | text | auto | Yes | No |
| Role | `role` | enum | 130px | Yes | Yes (options from roles API) |
| Team | `teamName` | text | 120px | Yes | No |
| Title | `jobTitle` | text | 140px | Yes | No |
| Email | `email` | text | auto | Yes | No |
| Phone | `phone` | text | 130px | Yes | No |
| Status | `isActive` | -- | 80px | Yes | No |
| Start Date | `startDate` | date | 100px | Yes | No |

The Name column renders with an `<app-avatar>` showing the employee's initials and avatar color, followed by the name in "Last, First" format.

Clicking a row navigates to `/employees/:id` (which redirects to the overview tab).

---

## Employee Detail

The `EmployeeDetailComponent` displays a header area with the employee's avatar, name, role, team, and email, followed by tab navigation and tab content.

### Header

- Avatar with initials and color
- Display name in "Last, First" format
- Role badge
- Back link to `/employees`

### Stats Bar

The `EmployeeStats` are loaded via `GET /api/v1/employees/:id/stats` and display key metrics:

| Stat | Field | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Hours This Period | `hoursThisPeriod` | Total hours tracked in the current pay period |
| Compliance | `compliancePercent` | Percentage of compliance forms completed |
| Active Jobs | `activeJobCount` | Number of currently assigned jobs |
| Training Progress | `trainingProgressPercent` | Percentage of training modules completed |
| Outstanding Expenses | `outstandingExpenseCount` / `outstandingExpenseTotal` | Count and total of unprocessed expenses |

### Tab Navigation

Tabs navigate via route parameters (`/employees/:id/:tab`). The active tab is derived from the route and data loads per-tab via `effect()`.

---

## Admin User Management (Related)

While the Employees feature is a read-only dashboard, employee account management is handled in the Admin panel at `/admin/users`. The following documents the admin user management form fields for completeness.

### User Create Dialog

Opened via the "New User" button in the admin users tab.

| Field | Control | FormControl | Required | Validators | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|------------|-------|
| First Name | `<app-input>` | `firstName` | Yes | `required`, `maxLength(100)` | |
| Last Name | `<app-input>` | `lastName` | Yes | `required`, `maxLength(100)` | |
| Email | `<app-input>` | `email` | Yes | `required`, `email`, `maxLength(256)` | Only shown for new users |
| Initials | `<app-input>` | `initials` | No | `maxLength(3)` | Auto-generated if not set |
| Role | `<app-select>` | `role` | Yes | `required` | Options loaded from `GET /api/v1/admin/roles` |
| Avatar Color | Color picker | `avatarColor` signal | No | -- | Grid of preset color swatches |

On creation, the admin receives a setup token (6-digit code) that the employee uses to complete their account setup (set password, PIN).

### User Edit Dialog

Same fields as create, plus:

| Field | Control | FormControl | Required | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Work Location | `<app-select>` | `workLocationId` | No | Only shown when multiple locations exist. Options from company locations. |
| Active | `<app-toggle>` | `isActive` | No | Toggle employee active status |
| Scan Identifiers | Section | -- | No | RFID/NFC/Barcode/Biometric identifiers |

### Scan Identifiers (within edit dialog)

Manage scan identifiers for kiosk authentication:

| Control | Type | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Existing identifiers list | Read-only | Shows type + value + remove button per identifier |
| Type selector | `<app-select>` | Options: RFID Card, NFC Tag, Barcode, Biometric |
| Value input | `<app-input>` | Identifier value (can be scanned from reader) |
| Add button | `action-btn action-btn--sm` | Adds the identifier |
| RFID Reader | Section | WebHID RFID reader pairing, connection status, relay client setup |
| Employee Barcode | `<app-barcode-info>` | Barcode from central barcode table |

### Setup Token Flow

When an admin creates a new user:
1. A setup token is generated (6-digit alphanumeric code)
2. The token and expiration date are displayed in a banner
3. Admin copies the code and shares it with the employee
4. Employee navigates to the setup page and enters the code
5. Employee sets their password, PIN, and completes their profile

For existing users without a password:
- Admin can click "Get Setup Code" to regenerate a setup token
- Admin can also send setup invite via email

---

## Work Location Assignment

An employee's `WorkLocationId` on `ApplicationUser` determines:

1. **State withholding form** -- The work location's state drives which state withholding form is presented during onboarding. States are categorized as no-tax, federal-W4, or state-specific-form.

2. **Admin assignment** -- The work location select in the admin user edit dialog is only shown when multiple company locations exist. Options come from `CompanyLocation` entities.

3. **Default location** -- Employees without a `WorkLocationId` default to the company's default location (the `CompanyLocation` with `IsDefault = true`).

---

## Role Assignment

Roles are assigned in the admin user create/edit dialog via the Role select field. Available roles are loaded from `GET /api/v1/admin/roles`, which returns all ASP.NET Identity roles.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Admin | Full system access |
| Manager | Team management, reports, time corrections, events |
| Engineer | Kanban, assigned work, files, expenses, time tracking |
| PM | Backlog, planning, leads, reporting |
| ProductionWorker | Simple task list, timer, card moves |
| OfficeManager | Customer/vendor, invoicing, employee documents |

Role assignment is single-role per user (the UI uses a single-select, not multi-select). The backend `UpdateAdminUserCommand` handles role changes via ASP.NET Identity's `UserManager`.

## Known Limitations

1. **Read-only feature** -- The Employees feature is entirely read-only. All employee data modification (profile updates, role changes, status changes) happens in the Admin panel or via the employee's own Account pages. There are no edit actions in the Employees feature.

2. **No direct employee creation** -- Employees are created through the Admin user management panel. The Employees feature has no "New Employee" button.

3. **Manager scope not enforced** -- While the backend receives the caller's user ID and admin status for the employee list query, the current implementation does not restrict managers to only their team members. All managers see all employees.

4. **No export** -- There is no export/download functionality for employee lists or detail data. Reporting on employee data is available through the Reports module.

5. **No inline profile editing** -- The overview tab shows profile data in read-only format. Managers cannot edit an employee's profile from this view -- they must use the Admin panel.

6. **Events tab shows only upcoming** -- The employee events tab calls `getUpcomingEventsForUser()`, which only returns future events. Past event history is not available in this view.

7. **No pagination** -- The employee list loads all employees in a single API call without pagination. This may become a performance concern for organizations with hundreds of employees.

8. **Single role per user** -- The admin user form uses a single-select for role assignment. Users cannot hold multiple roles simultaneously.
