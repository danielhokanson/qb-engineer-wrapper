### Industry Standard (SAP, Epicor, QuickBooks)
General ledger, accounts receivable/payable, bank reconciliation, fixed asset depreciation, budgeting, financial statements (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow), multi-currency, tax filing, audit trail.

### QB Engineer Implementation — **PARTIAL** (by design)

**Accounting Boundary Architecture:**
QB Engineer explicitly avoids duplicating a full accounting system. It operates in two modes:

**Standalone Mode** (no accounting provider):
- `Invoice` (20+ fields), `InvoiceLine`, `Payment`, `PaymentApplication` — full local CRUD
- AR aging reports, revenue reports, simple P&L
- Sales tax rates per state/jurisdiction
- Customer statements (PDF)
- Credit terms management

**Integrated Mode** (QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks, Sage, Zoho):
- Financial entities become read-only views of accounting system data
- Sync queue (`SyncQueueEntry`) for reliable data exchange
- Token encryption via Data Protection API
- Multiple provider support via `IAccountingService` interface

**What's comparable:**
- Invoicing with line items, tax, totals
- Payment recording and application to invoices
- AR aging
- Basic P&L reporting
- Sales tax management
- Multi-provider accounting integration

**What's intentionally excluded (by design):**
| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| General ledger | Accounting system responsibility |
| Bank reconciliation | Accounting system responsibility |
| AP (Accounts Payable) | Accounting system responsibility |
| Fixed asset depreciation | Accounting system responsibility |
| Budgeting | Accounting system responsibility |
| Balance sheet / cash flow | Accounting system responsibility |
| Multi-currency | Accounting system responsibility |
| Tax filing | Accounting system responsibility |

> This is a deliberate architectural decision, not a gap. The accounting boundary is well-documented and correctly scoped.

## Conclusion

QB Engineer is a remarkably comprehensive manufacturing platform for a single codebase. It covers the full quote-to-cash lifecycle, shop floor execution, inventory management, CRM, HR/training, compliance, and real-time collaboration — an integration surface that typically requires purchasing and connecting 3-5 separate products.

**For a job shop / make-to-order manufacturer with <100 employees**, QB Engineer provides competitive or superior functionality to products like JobBOSS, ProShop, and Fishbowl — with the added advantages of self-hosted AI, real-time collaboration, and a modern PWA architecture.

**For a larger manufacturer or one in regulated industries (automotive, aerospace, medical device)**, the gaps in MRP, SPC, CAPA/NCR, EDI, and finite scheduling would need to be addressed before QB Engineer could serve as a primary system.

The novel features (self-hosted AI/RAG, real-time SignalR collaboration, training LMS, compliance form extraction, terminology customization, form draft recovery) represent genuine innovation that no competitor offers in a manufacturing context.
