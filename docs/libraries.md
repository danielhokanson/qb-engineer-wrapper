## Self-Hosted AI (Optional Module)

All AI runs locally — no cloud calls, no data leaves the network.

### Infrastructure

| Component | Tool | Deployment |
|---|---|---|
| LLM Runtime | Ollama | Docker container (`qb-engineer-ai`) |
| Vector Storage | pgvector | Postgres extension (same `qb-engineer-db`) |
| Embedding Model | nomic-embed-text | Via Ollama |
| LLM Models | Llama 3.3 / Mistral / Qwen3 | Via Ollama, user's choice based on hardware |
| Web UI (optional) | Open WebUI | Docker container for direct model interaction |

### Models by Hardware

| Hardware | Model | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| CPU only, 16GB RAM | Mistral 7B / Phi-3 | ~5 tokens/sec (usable but slow) |
| GPU, 16GB+ VRAM | Llama 3.3 8B / Mistral 7B | ~30-50 tokens/sec |
| GPU, 48GB+ VRAM | Llama 3.3 70B / Qwen3 | Full capability |

### Use Cases

| Feature | How It Works | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Smart Search | Natural language → structured query: "overdue jobs for Acme" | Users skip filter syntax |
| Job Description Draft | From part + customer + specs, generate card description | Saves repetitive typing |
| QC Anomaly Detection | Analyze production run data for reject rate patterns | Catch quality drift early |
| Maintenance Prediction | Analyze machine hours + downtime history → suggest scheduling | Condition-based vs calendar-based |
| Document Q&A (RAG) | Index specs, SOPs, drawings → ask: "wall thickness for Part #12345?" | Instant answers from your docs |
| Notification Summary | Summarize a day's notifications into morning brief | Quick daily overview |
| Expense Categorization | Auto-suggest category from description | Reduce manual classification |

### Manufacturing-Specific Training (RAG Approach)

1. **Base model**: Open-source manufacturing-tuned model or general model (Llama 3.3)
2. **Local knowledge base**: Index into pgvector:
   - Part specs, BOM structures, material data
   - QC checklists and historical results
   - Maintenance logs and failure patterns
   - SOPs and process documents
   - Production run data and parameters
3. **RAG pipeline**: User question → retrieve relevant local docs → feed as context to LLM → answer grounded in your data
4. **Refresh cycle**: Re-index periodically as new data is added. Model knowledge stays current with production reality.
5. **Open source training data**: Start with publicly available manufacturing knowledge (ISO standards, GD&T references, material databases), fine-tune or augment with local data

### Integration Architecture

- .NET `IAiService` interface with `OllamaAiService` + `MockAiService` implementations
- Same mock pattern as QB: `MOCK_INTEGRATIONS=true` returns canned AI responses
- AI features degrade gracefully — if AI container is down, features fall back to manual workflows
- OpenAI-compatible REST API from Ollama — standard HTTP client in .NET
- Embedding generation runs as a Hangfire background job on data changes

### Docker Compose Addition

```yaml
qb-engineer-ai:          # Ollama LLM runtime
  image: ollama/ollama
  volumes:
    - ollama-models:/root/.ollama
  ports:
    - "11434:11434"
  deploy:
    resources:
      reservations:
        devices:
          - capabilities: [gpu]  # optional
```

Total containers: 7 (was 6) — AI container is optional.
