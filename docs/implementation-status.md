## Batch 26 Changelog — Admin Onboarding E2E + SubmitFormData Bug Fix (2026-03-20)

### Playwright E2E: Admin Onboarding (`admin-onboarding.spec.ts`)
- Full 9-step onboarding flow: Profile, Contact, Emergency Contact, W-4, I-9, State Withholding, Workers' Comp, Employee Handbook, Direct Deposit
- Cleaned up `page.evaluate()` debug diagnostic blocks from I-9 and State Withholding steps
- Fixed `acknowledgeForm()` to be idempotent: detects already-complete acknowledgment forms via `.form-detail__status--complete` and skips without error (handles re-runs)
- Fixed I-9 step: I-9 form was submitting to API (HTTP call reached server) but receiving 409 — see bug fix below
- Test now passes cleanly in ~47s; final screenshot shows all 6 forms completed (green checkmarks)

### Bug Fix: `ValidateRequiredFields` throws on `"required": null` in JSON
- **File:** `qb-engineer.api/Features/ComplianceForms/SubmitFormData.cs`
- **Root cause:** `I9FormDefinitionBuilder` serializes `["required"] = required` where `required` is `bool?`. Unset fields serialize as `"required": null`. `req.GetBoolean()` throws `InvalidOperationException` (not `JsonException`) on `null` values — bypassing the `catch (JsonException)` guard.
- **Fix:** Replaced `req.GetBoolean()` with `req.ValueKind != JsonValueKind.True` — only considers a field required if the JSON value is explicitly `true`.
- Applied same fix pattern to handle any other nullable boolean fields in form definitions safely.

---

## Batch 27 Changelog — Compliance PDF Download + Docs Accuracy (2026-03-21)

### Compliance Form PDF Download
- `DownloadSubmissionPdf` handler: `GET /api/v1/compliance-forms/submissions/{id}/pdf`

  - Otherwise → generates on-demand QuestPDF from `FormDefinitionVersion.FormDefinitionJson` + `FormDataJson`
  - PDF layout: form name header, submission date, labeled field/value pairs by section, page numbers
  - Access control: users see their own only; Admin/Manager/OfficeManager see any
- `ComplianceFormService.downloadSubmissionPdf()` (Angular): fetches as Blob, triggers browser download
- "Download PDF" button added to completed form card in `AccountTaxFormDetailComponent`
- i18n: `account.downloadFormCopy` added (en + es)

### Dead `src/assets/i18n/` Removed
- `qb-engineer-ui/src/assets/` was never served (angular.json assets root = `public/`)
- Deleted the duplicate `src/assets/i18n/en.json` and `src/assets/i18n/es.json`
- Canonical i18n path: `qb-engineer-ui/public/assets/i18n/`

### CLAUDE.md Documentation Accuracy Pass

- Added: Payroll, Chat, Reports (dynamic builder), AI, AI Assistants, Employee Compliance Forms, Quality, Sales Tax, Customer Returns, Production Lots, Scheduled Tasks, Notifications, Search to Features table
- Added: 12 missing entity groups to the Entity Structure section
- Added: "Planned / Partially Implemented" table replacing the single AR Aging "planned" row (AR Aging is implemented as a report; carrier APIs and alternative accounting providers correctly marked as remaining work)

- Tab renamed: `library` → `all-modules` (route segment + `TrainingTab` type)
- Page title: "Training Library" → "Training" (cleaner header)
- Tab order: My Learning → Learning Paths → All Modules (paths-first UX)

### Frontend: Manager Training Monitoring

- MinIO bucket: `qb-engineer-training-videos`

### Backend: Hangfire Queue Serialization
- Added dedicated `video-worker` Hangfire server in `Program.cs` with `WorkerCount = 1`
- Prevents concurrent Playwright sessions (OOM "Target crashed" when running 6+ simultaneously)
- Default server: `Queues = ["video","default"]`, 4+ workers for everything else
- Video server: `Queues = ["video"]`, 1 worker, named `video-worker`

### Backend: SeedData — 10-Chapter Video Content
- All 6 video modules (IDs 19–24) updated from 5-step to 10-step comprehensive content
- `EstimatedMinutes` updated: kanban 6→12, time-tracking 5→11, expenses 4→11, parts 7→12, reports 6→12, shop-floor 5→12

## Batch — Simulation Infrastructure & IClock (2026-04-03)

### IClock Abstraction
- `IClock` interface in `qb-engineer.core/Interfaces/` — injectable clock for testable time-dependent code
- `SystemClock` implementation (production): wraps `DateTime.UtcNow`
- `SimulationClock` implementation (E2E): controllable time for deterministic tests
- Registered via DI in `Program.cs`; `AppDbContext.SetTimestamps()` uses IClock

### Week Simulation Runner (Playwright)
- Full simulation framework spanning 431 weeks (2018–2026), ~22K+ actions, 8.7% error rate
- UI-driven via Playwright (not API-direct): navigates pages, fills forms, clicks buttons
- Resume support: queries API for latest simulation-era lead to skip already-processed weeks
- Expanded test data pools: 120 companies, 120 first/last names, scenario data
- `ui-actions.helper.ts`: reusable Playwright helpers (navigateTo, fillInput, fillMatSelect, fillDatepicker, clickButton)
- Auth seed injection via `seedAuth()` for pre-fetched session into browser context
- `data-testid` attributes added across templates (leads, expenses, kanban, quotes, POs, time tracking, chat, login)

### PostgreSQL Job Number Sequence
- Replaced app-level counter with Postgres sequence for race-condition-free job number generation

### Rate Limiting Bypass for E2E
- Loopback IP exemption in `Program.cs` for E2E throughput (rate limiter skips 127.0.0.1/::1)

---

## Batch — Seed Data, Versioning & Deployment (2026-04-03)

### Seed Data Migration to JSON
- Historical seed data (reference data, track types, stages) migrated from inline C# to JSON files
- `AppDbContext.SetTimestamps()` preserves explicit CreatedAt on seed entities

### Build Versioning
- `version.json` generated during build (git tag + commit hash)
- About dialog shows current version + checks GitHub latest release
- `environment.prod.ts` file swap fixed for production builds

### Deployment Script (`refresh.ps1`)
- PowerShell script: pulls latest from origin/main, rebuilds all Docker services with `--no-cache`
- `--force-recreate` + `docker rm -sf` for full clean rebuild
- Node modules volume detection, version baking

### Docker Health Check Fixes
- API health endpoint path corrected (`/api/v1/health`)
- UI container binds IPv4 for health check compatibility

### CSP Fix
- Google Fonts CDN allowed in Content-Security-Policy
- Material inline handler allowlisting

### Auth Interceptor Fix
- HTTP error interceptor now only logs out user on 401 from primary app API, not external APIs (e.g., Ollama, USPS)

### No-Cache Meta Tags
- `index.html` updated with cache-busting meta tags to prevent stale app shell after deployments

---

## Batch — Shop Floor Overhaul & RFID (2026-04-05)

- **Job actions overlay**: timer start/stop, Mark Complete with actions panel
- **IsShopFloor filter**: new boolean on `TrackType` + `JobStage` entities — filters display to physical-work stages only
- **Auto-dismiss timeouts**: PIN phase (20s), job-select phase (15s) — returns to scan screen on inactivity
- **Theme/font persistence**: saved to localStorage, persists across kiosk refreshes
- **Global loading overlay**: all shop floor actions show blocking overlay during API calls
- **Live elapsed timer**: client-side 1-second ticker computed from `timerStart`, no API polling

### RFID Relay Improvements
- Service cleanup, permission hardening (takeown/icacls for SYSTEM files)
- Unified `ScannerService` bridges WebHidRfidService scans into single signal source
- Scanner.stop() skipped on display routes to avoid lifecycle conflicts

### DataTable `clickableRows` Input
- New `clickableRows` input: pointer cursor + hover highlight on rows with `(rowClick)` handler
- Applied across all feature pages using row click navigation

---

## Batch — Form Draft System (2026-04-06)

### Draft Auto-Save System (Client-Side Only)

- **DraftStorageService**: IndexedDB wrapper with userId index
- **DraftBroadcastService**: cross-tab sync via `qb-engineer-draft-sync` BroadcastChannel
- **DraftRecoveryService**: post-login recovery prompt, 5-min TTL grace period, logout warning

### Centralized DialogComponent Integration
- All draft logic centralized in `DialogComponent` via `[draftConfig]` + `[draftFormGroup]` inputs
- `DraftConfig` model: entityType, entityId, route, optional snapshotFn/restoreFn for line-item forms
- Parent calls `dialogRef.clearDraft()` after successful save
- DialogComponent handles: adapter building, draft loading, auto-save registration, DestroyRef cleanup
- **26 dialog forms** converted to centralized pattern (zero per-component DraftableForm boilerplate)

### UI Components
- `DirtyFormIndicatorComponent`: orange dot + "Unsaved changes" chip in dialog header
- `DraftRecoveryBannerComponent`: "Recovered unsaved changes from [timestamp]. [Discard]" in dialog body
- `DraftRecoveryPromptComponent`: post-login MatDialog listing all drafts
- `LogoutDraftsDialogComponent`: logout confirmation with draft list

### Navigation Protection
- `unsavedChangesGuard` (`CanDeactivateFn`): warns on route navigation away from dirty forms
- `beforeunload` event: warns on browser close/refresh with unsaved changes
- DialogComponent dirty guard: backdrop/close click triggers ConfirmDialog when form dirty

### User-Configurable TTL
- Draft retention setting in Account > Customization (1 day / 3 days / 1 week / 2 weeks)
- Default: 1 week
- Restoring any draft resets TTL on all user drafts

### Date Transform Interceptor Fix
- Widened regex to match `+00:00` offset format (in addition to `Z` suffix)
