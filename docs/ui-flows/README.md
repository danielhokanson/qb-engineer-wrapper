## Common Functional Gaps (Cross-Cutting)

These gaps appear across multiple features and represent architectural-level
missing capabilities:

### Critical Missing Features

1. **No customer-facing portal** — Customers can't log in to view orders, invoices, or approve quotes
2. **No PDF/export from all list views** — Only some modules support CSV; no XLSX, no list-to-PDF
3. **No bulk import (CSV)** — Parts, customers, inventory, vendors all require manual entry or QB sync
4. **No audit log viewer** — AuditLogEntry entity exists but no admin UI to query it
5. **No advanced search** — Global search is header-level; no cross-module advanced query builder
6. **No scheduled report delivery** — No email digest or scheduled export
7. **No mobile app** — PWA exists but is not optimized for mobile-first workflows
8. **No dark mode in kiosk** — Shop floor display is always in light mode

### UX Patterns That Work Well

1. **Hover validation popovers** — Far cleaner than inline mat-error messages
2. **Shared DataTable** — Consistent sort/filter/column management across all list views
3. **URL as source of truth** — All state (tabs, filters, selected entity) reflected in URL
4. **DetailSidePanel** — Slide-out panels avoid full navigation for detail views
5. **Loading overlay system** — Two-tier loading (global vs. component-level) handles all scenarios
6. **SignalR real-time** — Board sync, timer sync, notifications all work without polling

### Accessibility Status

All components built to WCAG 2.2 AA:
- aria-labels on all icon-only buttons
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- Focus management in dialogs
- Color + icon (never color alone) for status indicators
- Touch targets ≥ 44px (88px on shop floor kiosk)
