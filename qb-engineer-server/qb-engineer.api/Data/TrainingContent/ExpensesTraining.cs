Managers can approve or reject pending expenses directly from the table.\n\n### Submission Flow\n\nTo submit an expense:\n1. Navigate to /expenses.\n2. Click the **Add Expense** button in the page header.\n3. Fill in Amount (required, min $0.01), Date (required), and Category (required — loaded from reference data configured in Admin).\n4. Optionally add a Description.\n5. Click **Submit**. The expense enters **Pending** status.\n\nOnce submitted, the expense appears in the main table for everyone to see.\n\n### Approval Workflow\n\nManagers and Admins can approve or reject pending expenses directly in the table. Each pending expense row shows two inline action buttons:\n- **Approve** (checkmark icon) — immediately marks the expense as Approved (green chip).\n- **Reject** (X icon) — immediately marks the expense as Rejected (red chip).\n\nThese action buttons only appear for expenses with Pending status.\n\n### Filtering and Search\n\nThe page header includes:\n- A **Search** input that filters by description, category, or submitter name.\n- A **Status** filter dropdown with options: All, Pending, Approved, Rejected, SelfApproved.\n- A **Total Amount** display showing the sum of currently visible expenses.\n\n### Expense Statuses\n\n- **Pending** (warning/yellow chip) — Awaiting manager approval.\n- **Approved** (success/green chip) — Reviewed and approved.\n- **Rejected** (error/red chip) — Reviewed and rejected.\n- **SelfApproved** (success/green chip) — Submitted by a manager with auto-approve privileges.\n\n### Draft Auto-Save\n\nThe expense dialog supports draft auto-save. If you accidentally close the dialog before saving, your form data is preserved in IndexedDB and restored when you reopen the dialog.",
