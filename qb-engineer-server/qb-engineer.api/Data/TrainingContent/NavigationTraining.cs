In its collapsed state, it shows only icons (52px wide). Hover or click the expand toggle to see full labels (200px wide). Your sidebar state is saved to your preferences — it persists across sessions and devices.\n\n**Sidebar sections:**\n- **Dashboard** — your daily home page with widgets\n- **Board** — the kanban board for active jobs\n- **Backlog** — all jobs not on the board\n- **Planning** — planning cycle management\n- **Parts** — parts catalog with BOMs and process steps\n- **Inventory** — stock levels, bins, movements\n- **Customers** — CRM with contacts and addresses\n- **Vendors** — vendor management and PO history\n- **Purchase Orders** — PO creation and receiving\n- **Sales Orders** — order management\n- **Quotes** — price quoting\n- **Shipments** — shipping and tracking\n- **Invoices** — billing (standalone mode)\n- **Payments** — payment recording (standalone mode)\n- **Leads** — sales pipeline\n- **Expenses** — expense submission and approval\n- **Assets** — equipment and tooling register\n- **Time Tracking** — timers and manual entries\n- **Quality** — QC templates and inspections\n- **Reports** — report builder and saved reports\n- **Calendar** — job due dates and PO deliveries\n- **Chat** — internal messaging\n- **AI** — AI assistant\n- **Training** — learning modules and paths\n- **Admin** — system configuration (admin only)\n- **Account** — your profile, compliance, security\n\n### Header Bar\n\nThe 44px header bar stays fixed at the top of every page. It contains:\n- **Search icon** — opens global search (searches jobs, parts, customers, vendors, and more)\n- **Notification bell** — shows unread count badge; click to open the notification panel\n- **Chat icon** — opens the chat panel; shows unread message count\n- **User avatar** — opens the user menu with theme toggle, account link, and logout\n\n### Theme Switching\n\nClick your avatar in the top-right and toggle between Light and Dark themes. Your choice is saved to localStorage and syncs across tabs immediately via the storage event. Dark theme swaps all CSS custom properties (--bg, --surface, --text, etc.).\n\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nPress **?** (question mark) anywhere to see available keyboard shortcuts. Common shortcuts include:\n- **/** — focus global search\n- **Ctrl+K** — open command palette\n- **Escape** — close current dialog or panel\n\n### URL-Based Navigation\n\nEvery significant view state is reflected in the URL. This means:\n- You can bookmark any page, tab, or filtered view\n- Browser back/forward buttons work naturally\n- Sharing a URL puts the recipient on the exact same view\n- Refreshing the page preserves your state","sections":[]}"""
