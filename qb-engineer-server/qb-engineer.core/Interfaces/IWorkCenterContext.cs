// The truth we capture is "where was the work physically happening when
// this event occurred" — derived from whichever operator currently has
// an open timer on the job. If no operator is actively timing, we
// honestly return (null, null) instead of guessing from stage metadata.
//
// Used by MoveJobStage, AddHold, ReleaseHold, SetWorkflowStatus, and
// any future handler that creates a job-event row.
