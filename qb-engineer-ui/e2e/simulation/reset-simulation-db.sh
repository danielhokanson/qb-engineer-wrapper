# reset-simulation-db.sh — Resets the database to its freshly-seeded state.
#
# Since simulation data and seed data share the same tables (customers, jobs,
# parts, etc.), the cleanest way to "remove just simulation data" is to drop
# the database entirely and let the API re-seed on startup.
#
# Usage:
#   cd qb-engineer-ui/e2e/simulation
#   bash reset-simulation-db.sh
#
# What it does:
#   1. Stops the API container (so nothing writes during reset)
#   2. Drops and recreates the qb_engineer database
#   3. Restarts the API container (which auto-runs migrations + seeds)
#   4. Waits for the API to become healthy
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Docker Compose stack running (at least db container)
#   - Run from anywhere inside the qb-engineer-wrapper repo
