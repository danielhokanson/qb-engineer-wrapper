 * Non-intrusive demo-mode marker set. Rendered only when `environment.demoMode`
 * is true. Every element is `pointer-events: none` so nothing this component
 * paints can block a click, obscure a target, or change layout height.
 *
 * Two markers:
 *   1. Obvious amber "DEMO" chip pinned to the top-right corner.
 *   2. Subtle full-viewport diagonal text watermark (~2% opacity). Survives
 *      cropping / resizing of screenshots — a tell only the site owner knows
 *      to look for when a "bug" screenshot shows up that was actually taken
 *      against the demo site.
