# refresh-demo.sh — Pull latest code, rebuild, and restart the static demo site
#
# The demo site is a single nginx container serving an Angular bundle + static
# JSON fixtures. No database, no API — all data is synthesized in-browser.
# This script pulls the latest code, rebuilds the demo image with new hashes,
# and restarts the container so clients pick up fresh bundles on next visit.
#
# Usage:
#   ./refresh-demo.sh
